# One-Sided Crossing Minimization Solver

This is an heuristic solver for the One-Sided Crossing Minimization Problem (OCM), a problem in graph theory that involves arranging the nodes of a bipartite graph on two layers (typically horizontal), with one of the layers fixed. The objective is to minimize the number of edge crossings between the layers.

**Usage**  

To compute an order for a given graph, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py  
```
The graph is received as standard input (stdin), and the solution is output as standard output (stdout).
The input graph must be in the format described in https://pacechallenge.org/2024/io/ .
